<h1>John Clever's Github Page!</h1>
<p>This page will have signifigantly more stuff on it in due time, but for now, I just have a emulator I need to patch, and some games I need to program.
 In any case, I will be importing a flash game section of the site along with emulators if you don't care about any of the important works on the site. 
 The site will be split into private stuff you can't acess, my mathy nerdy works, and the entertainment located where are the flash games are, and if you came from Nathan, that part of the site is the sister page I was talking about. 
 In about a week or two, I'll be caught up with the games.<br/> Side Note: For the most part, the UI will be a bit crappy until I get some more HTML5 under my belt, and get the site to work.</p>
<p>Currently, The only thing I have up right now is the emulator. The second link has full screen, but will be very laggy without full screen. The other one does not have full screen, but that is he only technical difference. I plan to get a DOSBOX emulator up on here soon.</p>
