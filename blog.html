This is John William Clever's blog, and if I'm writing the code right, the general public should not be able to access this.
<br><br>
However, if you do happen to be someone other than the author, I either did not write my code 
correctly, or you hacked my website or account, in which case I congratulate you.
<br><br>
As of the time of writing, there is not a table of contents in this blog, but I will add it eventually, somewhere around here. I will also set up an archive eventually, but a table of contents takes precedence due to the site being relatively new.
<br><br>
Secretly, I sometimes wish that someone would read my diary, without any prompt from me. That person could truly see into my mind and thoughts, even if they had never heard the name 'John William Clever'.
<br><br>
The same goes for the blog, I suppose. Perhaps the I only write self-referential documents so I can be remembered, for better or worse, after my death.
<br><br>
I don't know if everyone thinks this way. I'm not sure. 
<br><br>
I am probably going to fail a class if I keep this up.
<br><br>
I really should stop doing some of my extracurriculars. I currently am studying vector calculus, complex analysis, Dostoevsky, the Japanese language, Piano, and classical physics. This alone takes up about six hours of my day, assumming each takes up 90 minutes per day. Adding two hours of homework and six hours of school, I need fourteen hours to accomplish my studies alone. If I add two hours of miscellaneous activities, (such as this website!) I need to be working nonstop for sixteen hours everyday, which has lately been causing me to get bad grades.
